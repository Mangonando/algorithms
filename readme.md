# Algorithms Training

#### Here is my constant training and improving solving problems.

**You will see at least two solutions**
* Solution
* Bettter Solution

**Solution**
This is the solution I gave to the problem first. The one I crafted from scratch and sometimes it might not be the most optimal solution.

**Better Solution**
This is my conclusion after further understanding of the problem and perhaps checking it with peers and different ways to solve the algorithms.
